TODO Items
----------

The sequence matching the expression `^\s\*- [ ].\*` marks a line as a TODO list item.

Example
-------

- [ ] Not done
- [X] Done

Items Hierarchy
---------------

If one item has lesser indentation than the next one then the first one is meant
to be 'parent' and the second to be 'child'.

Example
-------

- [ ] Parent
  - [ ] Child1
  - [ ] Child2

Rules:
* Changing state of the parent item changes the state of all children items accorndantly
* If all children items are marked done, parent will also be marked as done
* If parent is marked as done and one of the children changes state to not done
  parent will also be marked as not done


Items Highlighting
------------------

Items are highlighted in accordance to the following scheme:

- [ ] ! Important item (Underlined)
- [ ] Normal item (Normal)
- [X] Done item (Comment)



Items moving on state change
----------------------------

By default item when its status is changed is moved in the list in accordance
to the following rules

Mark item done
--------------

Item marked as done is moved to the end of all done items list.
If done list doesn't exist, item is placed just after the last not done item.

Before
------

- [ ] Not Done 1
- [ ] Will be done now
- [ ] Not Done 2
- [X] Done

After
-----

- [ ] Not Done 1
- [ ] Not Done 2
- [X] Done
- [X] Will be done now

Mark item undone
----------------

Undone item is moved to the end of all not done items list.
If all items are marked done, the items is moved before the first done item.

Before
------

- [ ] Not Done 1
- [ ] Not Done 2
- [X] Done
- [X] Will be undone now

After
-----

- [ ] Not Done 1
- [ ] Not Done 2
